OsmiumScope is a Java based R&D tool for Osmium MIMU22BL/P(X), which allows data logging and analysis. It is useful for STEM experiments. OsmiumScope receives and plots motion data, i.e. 3-axis acceleration, 3-axis angular rotation speed and 3-axis magnetic strength, in real-time from Osmium MIMU22BL/P(X) via USB. It also saves data in logfile.

Following dependencies are used in implementation::

  -- RXTX jar and native library from http://fizzed.com/oss/rxtx-for-java
  
  -- JOGL jar from https://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Downloading_and_installing_JOGL

RXTX - a Java cross platform wrapper library for the serial port

JOGL - Java OpenGL (JOGL) is a wrapper library that allows OpenGL to be used in the Java programming language.
